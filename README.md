- Studying Computer Engineering at Memorial University of Newfoundland.

- Using my Github to post personal projects and school assingments

- I am constantly trying to learn more about programing, and this page is going to be used to document the new things I learn!

- Currently I'm trying to learn more about C++, it's a challenging language but I believe it is helping me gain a better core understanding of programming.
  Especially with regards to how code interacts with memory.

- My code can always be better so any sugggestions on improvment are welcome!
